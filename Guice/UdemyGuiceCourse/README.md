# Udemy course on Google Guice

https://www.udemy.com/course/dependency-injection-by-google-section2_guice/

Done till: Section 3

Section 5, 7 - good summaries

If I define a constructor, on injector.getInstance(SquareRequest.class) it calls my constrictor with args 
since there is no default constructor, and injects whatever needed.
If I didnt define constructor, calls no args constructor itself and can inject with setter method or field injection
